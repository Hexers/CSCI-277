4) Write a detailed set of instructions in English to calculate the dollar amount of money in a piggybank that contains h half-dollars, q quarters, n nickels, d dimes, and p pennies.


Step 1: Isolate all variables.

Step 2: Assign variable values.

Step 3: Calculate total amount of each piece of change.

(This is just in mathematical values, not actual c++ variables, as it would not work with such variable names)
h = x*0.50;
q = x*0.25;
n = x*0.05;
d = x*0.10;
p = x*0.01;

Step 4: Calculate total amount of money.

total = (h + q + n + d + p);
