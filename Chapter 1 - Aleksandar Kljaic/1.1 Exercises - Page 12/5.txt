5) Write a set of detailed, step-by-step instructions in English to find the smallest number in a group of three integer numbers.

Step 1: Assign A, B, C to each of the three integer numbers.

Step 2: Check all possible combinations 
Is A less than or equal to B
Is A less than or equal to C
Is B less than or equal to A
Is B less than or equal to C
Etc...etc..etc..


Step 3: For this we will assume A is the smallest.

We check if A is less than or equal to B, if it isn't, then B is the smallest so far, then we check if B is less than or equal to C, if B is smaller than C, then B is the smallest number.
