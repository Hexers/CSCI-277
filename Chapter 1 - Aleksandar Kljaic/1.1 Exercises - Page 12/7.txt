	4) Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the match to JEAN is found or until the end of the list.


7b) Discuss how you would imrpove your algorithm for Exercise 7a if the list of names were arranged in alphabetical order.


	1) Search  "J" alphabetically and then Locate and compare the first name starting at "J" with JEAN

	2) Stop the search if the match to JEAN is found

	3) Otherwise compare JEAN with the next name on the list "J" alphabetically
