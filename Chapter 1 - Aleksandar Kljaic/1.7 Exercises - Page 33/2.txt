distance = average speed x time

d=rt

2a) For this programming problem, how many outputs are required?

	Three, distance, average speed, and time.

2b) How many inputs does this problem have?

	Two, average speed and time
	
2c) Write an algorithm for converting the input items into output items
	
	d=r*t;

2d) Test the algorithm written for Exersize 2c using the following sample data: speed is 55 miles per hour and time is 2.5 hours

	d=r*t;

	d = 55 * ((2.5)*60);

	d = 55 * 150;

	d = 8250;

2e) How much the algorithm you wrote in Exercise 2c be modified if the elapsed time is given in minutes instead of hours?

	d = r * t;

	d = 55 * ((2.5)*60); // Calculate distance equals miles per hour times (hours times minutes) to convert hours to minutes.

	d = 55 * 150; // Calculate distance equals miles per hour times time.

	d = 8250 / 60; // Convert minutes to hours.
